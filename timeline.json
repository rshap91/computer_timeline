Due to rising Cold War tensions, the Air Force was looking to invest in new technology and Project Whirlwind became the center piece of this investment. With this new investment, Jay Forrester and grad student William N. Papian went on to develop a new memory technology called Magnetic-Core Memory which was much faster than all other memory technology at the time. After two years of research, they implemented magnetic core memory into Project Whirlwind making it by far the fastest computer currently in existence.",
